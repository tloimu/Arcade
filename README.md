This is a root for my Unity projects for my personal learning purposes. Currently, using Unity 5.3. I shamelessly use the Unity's standard free assets for this as the purpose for these projects is simply learning to use Unity.

# Project *Arcade*

This is an _Omega Race_ influenced game (remember Commodore VIC-20). To build, copy Unity's assets from _Space Shooter_ tutorial, _Standard Assets_ and _Unity Test Tools_ to

../Assets/Standard
